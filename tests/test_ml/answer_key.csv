"Consider the problem of writing a framework for desktop applications. Such applications are typically organized around documents or files. Their operation usually begins with a command to create or edit a word processing document, spreadsheet, time line, or other type of document the application is intended to work with. A framework to support this type of application will include high-level support for common operations such as creating, opening, or saving documents.",Factory Method
"Suppose you have the task of building a user-interface framework that works on top of multiple windowing systems, such as Windows, Motif, or MacOS. It must work on each platform with the platform's native look and feel. You organize it by creating an abstract class for each type of widget (text field, pushbutton, list box, etc.) and then writing a concrete subclass of each of those classes for each supported platform. To make this robust, you need to ensure that all the widget objects created are for the desired platform.",Abstract Factory
Consider the problem of writing an email gateway program. The program receives e-mail messages that are in MIME format. It forwards them in a different format for different kinds of e-mail systems.,Builder
"Suppose that you are writing a Computer-Assisted Design (CAD) program that allows its users to draw diagrams from a palette of symbols. The program will have a core set of built-in symbols. However, people with different and specialized interests will use the program. The core set of symbols will not be adequate for people with a specialized interest. These people will want additional symbols that are specific to their interests. Most users of this program will have a specialized interest. It must be possible to provide additional sets of symbols that users can add to the program to suit their needs.",Prototype
"Suppose you need to write a class that an applet can use to ensure that no more than one audio clip is played at a time. If an applet contains two pieces of code that independently play audio clips, then it is possible for both to be playing at the same time. When two audio clips play at the same time, the results depend on the platform. The results may range from confusing, with users hearing both audio clips together, to terrible, with the platform's sound-producing mechanism unable to cope with playing two different audio clips at once.",Singleton
"Suppose you have been given the assignment of writing a class library to provide access to a proprietary database. Clients will send queries to the database through a network connection. The database server will receive queries through the network connection and return the results through the same connection. For a program to query the database, it must have a connection to the database. A convenient way for programmers who will use the library to manage connections is for each part of a program that needs a connection to create its own connection.",Object Pool
"Suppose that you are writing a method that copies an array of objects. The method is supposed to filter out objects that do not meet certain criteria, so that the copied array may not contain all of the elements in the original array. To promote reuse, you want the method to be independent of the filtering criteria being used.",Adapter
"Suppose you are writing classes to browse inventory in a warehouse. There will be a user interface that allows a user to see the description, quantity on hand, location, and other information about each inventory item. The inventory browsing classes will be part of a customizable application. For this reason, they must be independent of the actual class that provides collections of inventory items.",Iterator
"Suppose you need to provide Java classes that access physical sensors for control applications. These are devices such as scales, speed-measuring devices, and location-sensing devices. What these devices have in common is that they perform a physical measurement and produce a number. One way that these devices differ is in the type of measurement that they produce. The scale produces a single number based on a measurement at a single point in time. The speed-measuring device produces a single measurement that is an average over a period of time. The location-sensing device produces a stream of measurements. The software that you are writing will need to work with sensors from multiple manufacturers called Eagle and Hawk.",Bridge
"Consider the organization of classes to support the creation and sending of email messages. To use these classes, a client must know of at least these six of them, the relationships between them, and the order in which it must create instances of the classes. If every client of these classes must take on this additional complexity, it makes the email classes more difficult to reuse.",Facade
"Suppose that you are writing a word processor. The word processor is structured around classes such as DocumentElement, DocChar, DocumentContainer, and CharacterContext. Each DocChar object represents an individual character within a document. However, the current design allocates a separate DocChar object for each character, potentially leading to excessive memory usage, especially for larger documents. To address this issue, there's a proposal to optimize memory usage by introducing shared DocChar objects for characters that occur multiple times within the document. This revised design involves reorganizing the classes and moving extrinsic attributes like font information outside the DocChar class into a CharacterContext class.",Flyweight
"Suppose you are writing software for a new kind of smart food processor that can be fed raw ingredients and by slicing, dicing, mixing, boiling, baking, frying, and stirring is able to produce cooked, ready-to-eat food. On a mechanical level, the new food processor is a very sophisticated piece of equipment. However, a crucial part of the food processor is a selection of programs to prepare different kinds of foods. A program that can turn flour, water, yeast, and other ingredients into different kinds of bread is very different from a program that can stir-fry shrimp to exactly the right texture. The food processor will be required to run a great variety of programs that allow it to produce a great variety of foods. Because of the large variety of programs that will be required, it is not possible to build them all into the food processor. Instead, the food processor will load its programs from a CD-ROM or similar medium.",Dynamic Linkage
"Suppose you are part of a team that has written a large Java applet for a company that operates a chain of home improvement warehouses. The applet allows people to buy everything that the warehouses sell through a Web page. In addition to offering a catalog, it includes a variety of assistants to allow customers to decide just what they need. There are more assistants, but they are not the point of this discussion. The point is that the applet is very large. Due to its size, it takes an unacceptably long amount of time for a browser to download the applet over a modem connection.",Virtual Proxy
"Suppose you are responsible for maintaining the software of a security system that controls physical access to a building. Its basic architecture is that a card reader or other data entry device captures some identifying information and passes the information to the object that controls a door. If the object that controls the door is satisfied with the information, it unlocks the door. Suppose that you need to integrate this access control mechanism with a surveillance system. A surveillance system typically has more cameras connected to it than it has TV monitors. Most of the TV monitors cycle through the images from different cameras. They show a picture from each camera for a few seconds and then move on to the next camera for which the monitor is responsible. There are rules about how the surveillance system is supposed to be set up to ensure its effectiveness.",Decorator

"Suppose that you are working for a company that manufactures smoke detectors, motion sensors, and other security devices. To take advantage of new market opportunities, your company plans to introduce a new line of devices. These devices will be able to send a signal to a security card that can be installed in most computers. The hope is that companies that make security-monitoring systems will integrate these devices and cards with their systems. To make it easy to integrate the cards with monitoring systems, you have been given the task of creating an easy-to-use API. The API must allow your future customers to easily integrate their programs with it so their programs will receive notifications from the security card. It must work without forcing the customers to alter the architecture of their existing software. All that the API may assume about the customer's software is that at least one, and possibly more than one, object will have a method that should be called when a notification is received from a security device.",Observer
Suppose that you are writing a dialog for editing parameters of a program. The dialog will have buttons for specifying the disposition of changes you have made. The dialog will have an OK button that saves the parameter values in the dialog to both a file and the program's working values. The dialog will have a Save button that saves the parametervalues only to a file. The dialog will have an Apply button that saves the parameter values only to the program's working values. The dialog will have a Revert button that restores the dialog values from the file.,State

Suppose you have to write a program that displays calendars. One of the requirements for the program is that it be able to display sets of holidays celebrated by different nations and different religious groups. The user must be able to specify which sets of holidays to display. You would like to satisfy the requirement by putting the logic for each set of holidays in a separate class. This will give you a set of small classes to which you could easily add more classes. You want classes that use these holiday classes to be unaware of any specific set of holidays.,Strategy
"Suppose that you have the task of writing a reusable class for logging users into an application or applet. In addition to being reusable and easy to use, the tasks of the class will be to: Prompt the user for a user ID and password. Authenticate the user ID and password. The result of the authentication operation should be an object. If the authentication operation produces some information needed later as proof of authentication, then the object produced by the authentication operation should encapsulate the information. While the authentication operation is in progress, the user should see a changing and possibly animated display that tells the user that authentication is in progress and all is well. Notify the rest of the application or applet that login is complete and make the object produced by the authentication operation available to the rest of the application. Every application or applet will have to provide its own logic for these tasks.",Template Method
"Suppose you have the assignment of adding new features to a word processor related to its ability to produce a table of contents. From the viewpoint of a user, there will be a dialog that allows the user to specify information that guides the building of a table of contents. The word processor allows a style name to be associated with each paragraph. The dialog will allow the user to specify which paragraph styles correspond to headings that should appear in the table of contents. The word processor uses information specified in the dialog to build an internal table that contains all the information it needs to build a multilevel table of contents. In the rest of this description, the table is referred to as the internal ToC table. The information in each row of the table will include a level number that can correspond to chapter, section, and subsection or any other hierarchical organization the user wants to represent. The rows of the table will also include a paragraph style and other information for formatting the table of contents. If a paragraph style appears in the table, it means paragraphs with that style are headings whose first line will appear in that level of a table of contents. In addition to adding the dialog and internal ToC table to the word processor, you will have to add these table-of-contents-related features: Generate and insert a table of contents for a single file document into that document. Reorganize a single file document into a multifile document, based on a heading level in the internal ToC table.",Visitor
"If an application is to be portable, it needs to encapsulate platform dependencies. These ""platforms"" might include: windowing system, operating system, database, etc. Too often, this encapsulation is not engineered in advance, and lots of #ifdef case statements with options for all currently supported platforms begin to procreate like rabbits throughout the code.",Abstract Factory

"Object pools (otherwise known as resource pools) are used to manage the object caching. A client with access to a Object pool can avoid creating a new Objects by simply asking the pool for one that has already been instantiated instead. Generally the pool will be a growing pool, i.e. the pool itself will create new objects if the pool is empty, or we can have a pool, which restricts the number of objects created.It is desirable to keep all Reusable objects that are not currently in use in the same object pool so that they can be managed by one coherent policy.

"One of the dominant strategies of object-oriented design is the ""open-closed principle"". Figure demonstrates how this is routinely achieved - encapsulate interface details in a base class, and bury implementation details in derived classes. Clients can then couple themselves to an interface, and not have to experience the upheaval associated with change: no impact when the number of derived classes changes, and no impact when the implementation of a derived class changes. A generic value of the software community for years has been, ""maximize cohesion and minimize coupling"". The object-oriented design approach shown in figure is all about minimizing coupling. Since the client is coupled only to an abstraction (i.e. a useful fiction), and not a particular realization of that abstraction, the client could be said to be practicing ""abstract coupling"" . an object-oriented variant of the more generic exhortation ""minimize coupling"".
A more popular characterization of this ""abstract coupling"" principle is ""Program to an interface, not an implementation"".Clients should prefer the ""additional level of indirection"" that an interface (or an abstract base class) affords. The interface captures the abstraction (i.e. the ""useful fiction"") the client wants to exercise, and the implementations of that interface are effectively hidden",Strategy
